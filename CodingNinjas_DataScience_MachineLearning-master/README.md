# Data Science and Machine Learning Course by Coding Ninjas
This repository contains my Jupyter notebook notes for the said course by [CodingNinjas](https://github.com/CodingNinjasCodes).

I have tried to write notebooks in a way that they are sufficient on their own to learn the basics of Python, Machine Learning and Data Science.
