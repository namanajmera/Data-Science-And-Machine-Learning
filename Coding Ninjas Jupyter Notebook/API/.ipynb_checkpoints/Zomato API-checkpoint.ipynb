      "Abhijeet Sengupta 2 Went to check out all the hype. It's a small property adjacent to The Unplugged Courtyard in L Block, Middle Circle CP. Now I know a number of outlets in Delhi NCR who have done a fine job in a limited space of operation. This one, however, is an example as to how things can go wrong. Their lounges/sofas are very low and their tables are higher. As a result both seating and eating are a problem. We also noticed unsafe electrical attachments that can cause a fire hazard with a spill of drink.  We ordered fries and pizza in a jar and Nutella milk shake. The shake was good however the straw provided kept sinking into the drink. Fries in a jar was decent but the Pizza in a jar is bad. Need to rethink the cuisine or better stick to pastas or maybe pies in jars.\n",

Special shoutout to Vikram (our server) who listened intently to what I wanted in a drink. Judged what kind of drink i’d like and recommended Jin Gin. His confidence impressed us and so did the drink! If you are willing to try a non traditional spicy cocktail go for this.  We finished with the first dessert on the menu (long name, so I forgot) but it was quite delicious!  Overall good experience! 😃\n",
